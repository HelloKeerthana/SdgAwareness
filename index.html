        <h2>What are SDGs?</h2>
        <p id="description">
            The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. They are a set of interconnected global goals adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
            The SDGs address the global challenges we face, including poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace, and justice. They provide a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future.
